There are many [libraries in Python for working with PDFs](https://www.educative.io/courses/pdf-management-python/39Oy3MD180n), each with their pros and cons, the most common one being `PyPDF2`. Note the case sensitivity - you need to make sure your capitilisation matches.\n","\n","<!--<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you are in the AI 2 virtual environment before you execute this command. Otherwise you will have problems when importing the `PyPDF2` library.-->\n","\n","If you are using a local environment you will need to run the following command in the prompt:\n","\n","    pip install PyPDF2\n","    \n","Keep in mind that not every PDF file can be read with this library. It won't be able to read PDFs that are too blurry, have a special encoding, are encrypted, or maybe were just created with a particular program that doesn't work well with PyPDF2.\n","\n","If you find yourself in this situation, try using the libraries linked above, but keep in mind, these may also not work. The reason for this is because of the many different parameters for a PDF and how varied the settings can be, text could be shown as an image instead of a utf-8 encoding.\n","\n","As far as PyPDF2 is concerned, it can only read the text from a PDF document, it won't be able to grab images or other media files from a PDF.\n","\n","Copy the document `A_Midsummer_Night.pdf` into a folder called `NLP` on your Google Drive.
